# Learning Vulkan

Originally, this repository was following the [vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction) step for step.

But after having gone through it, I have diverted to doing my own thing. I'm still learning Vulkan, but more through experimentation than following tutorials

It still really helped me learn the basic concepts of Vulkan though, so I will still greatly recommend that tutorial

~~I am following the [vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction) to learn how Vulkan works~~

~~I am already familiar with OpenGL, so Vulkan is the next step~~

## What is this

~~This is the project for getting the basic triangle drawn on screen. So see this as a template-ish kinda project~~

This repository is me fucking around with Vulkan and learning through experimentation

This repo currently has a custom VRM (model format) importer and supports blend shapes!
